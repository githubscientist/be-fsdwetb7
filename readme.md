### What is NodeJS?

- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
- Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

### What is npm?

- npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.
- npm is extremely fast, and helps to manage the packages that you download.
- npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.

### Package.json

- package.json is the manifest file for Node.js projects and it holds metadata relevant to the project.
- It holds various metadata relevant to the project like the name, version, description, homepage, etc.
- It also holds the list of dependencies.
